PTT:
Starts transmitting before i press the button. I guess it clears the buffer out, so when I hit PTT
I hear half a second of audio from before I hit the button, including the mouse button clicking.
UPDATE: calling line.flush() right before startRecord, mostly mitigates the issue


PLAYBACK:
There's still a bug where player will playback a tiny part of buffer over and over again.
--Might be reproducible by spam clicking PTT?


SETTINGS FILE
  create a settings file in appdata, (cross-platform)
  create it on startup with defaults
  write to it when settings change **NEXT**
  TODO: do this in a reasonable way, without duplicate code

ENCRYPTION
  don't know enough to get this in, how do you end to end encrypt in a p2p network?
  all ssl certificates are self-signed for convenience..
  web of trust?
  TLS
  OCB-AES128 for encrypted voice comms

Right now, hard to test that audio is still sent after reconnect.
When we read an audio file, we read it all really quickly and send.
Need to make a rate-limited file reader for testing

PROBLEM:
PlayQueue & Recorder actors pretty much block a thread in the javax write function.
Does this only happen while playing audio?
What happens with a lot of inactive peers? -> Inactive PlayQueues

Should BigBoss hold a record of messages received - probably
Need to think more about how this works, replay and all that

Where do I store icons and stuff?

Completion:
  Stable lobby of 10 people
    If one person joins, they are connected via PEX to other members quickly
    Auto-reconnect - rate limited, timeouts
    Lobby-members cede their connect ability, A lobby member can't unilaterally connect to someone
    out-of-lobby, they can invite them, and the invitee can accept
      Generally, add a UI hook where users decide to accept connections (PEX excluded?)
  Friends List

Enhance file reading/writing features
  support peer joining mid-playback
  support opening multiple files in order
  support opening multiple files at once
