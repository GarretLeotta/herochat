SETTINGS FILE
  create a settings file in appdata, (cross-platform)
  create it on startup with defaults
  write to it when settings change **NEXT**
  TODO: do this in a reasonable way, without duplicate code


ENCRYPTION
  don't know enough to get this in, how do you end to end encrypt in a p2p network?
  all ssl certificates are self-signed for convenience..
  web of trust?
  TLS
  OCB-AES128 for encrypted voice comms


PROBLEM:
PlayQueue & Recorder actors pretty much block up a thread in the javax write function.
Does this only happen while playing audio?
What happens with a lot of inactive peers? -> Inactive PlayQueues
Need to run benchmarks:
  lot of inactive peers
  lot of peers talking at once


Should BigBoss hold a record of messages received - probably
Need to think more about how this works, replay and all that

Where do I store icons and stuff?

Completion:
  Stable lobby of 10 people
    If one person joins, they are connected via PEX to other members quickly
    Auto-reconnect - rate limited, timeouts
    Lobby-members cede their connect ability, A lobby member can't unilaterally connect to someone
    out-of-lobby, they can invite them, and the invitee can accept
      Generally, add a UI hook where users decide to accept connections (PEX excluded?)
  Friends List

Enhance file reading/writing features
  support peer joining mid-playback
  support opening multiple files in order
  support opening multiple files at once

NOISE REDUCTION
  RNNoise
    uses machine learning to reduce noise, supposedly fast
    available in C under BSD license

PTT:
  Starts transmitting before i press the button. I guess it clears the buffer out, so when I hit PTT
  I hear half a second of audio from before I hit the button, including the mouse button clicking.
  UPDATE: calling line.flush() right before startRecord, mostly mitigates the issue

Should clear play buffers if we haven't received any audio in bufferSizeInSeconds or so
This way the replay bug won't happen if the peer is a bad actor and doesn't send EndOfSegment
