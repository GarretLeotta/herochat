SETTINGS FILE
  create a settings file in appdata, (cross-platform)
  create it on startup with defaults
  write to it when settings change **NEXT**
  TODO: do this in a reasonable way, without duplicate code


ENCRYPTION
  don't know enough to get this in, how do you end to end encrypt in a p2p network?
  all ssl certificates are self-signed for convenience..
  web of trust?
  TLS
  OCB-AES128 for encrypted voice comms


PROBLEM:
PlayQueue & Recorder actors pretty much block up a thread in the javax write function.
Does this only happen while playing audio?
What happens with a lot of inactive peers? -> Inactive PlayQueues
Need to run benchmarks:
  lot of inactive peers
  lot of peers talking at once


Should BigBoss hold a record of messages received - probably
Need to think more about how this works, replay and all that

Where do I store icons and ui stuff?

Completion - Basic functionality:
  Stable lobby of ~10 people
    If one person joins, they are connected via PEX to other members quickly
    Auto-reconnect - rate limited, timeouts
    Lobby-members cede their connect ability, A lobby member can't unilaterally connect to someone
    out-of-lobby, they can invite them, and the invitee can accept
      Generally, add a UI hook where users decide to accept connections (PEX excluded?)
    --above is  little weird

Enhance file reading/writing features
  support peer joining mid-playback - requires rate-limited file reader
  support a playlist
  virtual user? -- Norbert, Norbert (Music)

NOISE REDUCTION
  RNNoise
    uses machine learning to reduce noise, supposedly fast
    available in C under BSD license


Should clear play buffers if we haven't received any audio in bufferSizeInSeconds or so
This way the replay bug won't happen if the peer is a bad actor and doesn't send EndOfSegment
