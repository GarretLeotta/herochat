what about a Forward(ActorRef, Message) class, that tells the next actor to forward the message to the next guy
  drawback 1: need to add forwarding logic to every fucking actor class
  drawback 2: (benefit actually) Forward(A1, Forward(A2, Forward(A3, Forward(A4, Forward(A5, "Fuck You")))))
This is a good idea, just use speicific forward messages, ie ToBigBoss, ToView


Enhance file reading/writing features
  support peer joining mid-playback
  support opening multiple files in order
  support opening multiple files at once


Should BigBoss hold a record of messages received - probably
Need to think more about how this works, replay and all that

Where do I store icons and stuff?

Completion:
  Stable lobby of 10 people
    If one person joins, they are connected via PEX to other members quickly
    Auto-reconnect - rate limited, timeouts
    Lobby-members cede their connect ability, A lobby member can't unilaterally connect to someone
    out-of-lobby, they can invite them, and the invitee can accept
      Generally, add a UI hook where users decide to accept connections (PEX excluded?)
  Friends List


Right now, hard to test that audio is still sent after reconnect.
When we read an audio file, we read it all really quickly and send.
Need to make a rate-limited file reader for testing
