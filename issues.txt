audio all choppy - if you print to console a lot
  need to implement a latency, or fps counter

when you mute, it plays the last frames in buffer over and over
  didnt happen on second try, after removing prints, maybe it is a race condition
  yeah, it happens every 4th mute or so

  I actually think it happens every time, but sometimes the buffer is mostly empty
  1. I think I need to frame audio data when we are sending it, so like:
  START_TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . TALK . END_TALK
  2. or implement a check if the buffer is empty or struggling and top it up with zeros
  2 will take a bit of experimenting, but seems easier
